This is the final project for DIDA-325, "Data and Society." This project was completed by:

Rose Snyder (Question 1 -  What are the user profiles of the bike users?)
Pax Zissler (Question 2 - Which stations in New York are the most popular?)
McKenzie Skrastins (Question 3 - Can a regression model be created to predict the trip duration of a user's ride, based on their gender, age, subscriber status, time of day, start location, etc.?)
Joseph Fleishman (Question 4 - Which time of day has the longest bike rides?)

We all contributed to the data cleaning and write-up.
