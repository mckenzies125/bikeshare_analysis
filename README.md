This is the final project for DIDA-325, "Data and Society." This project was completed by:


Rose Snyder (Question 1 -  What are the user profiles of the bike users?)

Pax Zissler and Joseph Fleishman (Question 2 - Which stations in New York are the most popular?)

McKenzie Skrastins (Question 3 - Can a regression model be created to predict the trip duration of a user's ride, based on their gender, age, subscriber status, time of day, start location, etc.?)

Joseph Fleishman (Question 4 - Which time of day has the longest bike rides?)


We all contributed to the data cleaning and write-up.


The selection of machine learning models that were allowed to be used for Question 3 was limited to what was covered by the professor. So, a Random Forest model was used for the official write-up. After the class concluded, McKenzie applied a Gradient Boosted Model on the dataset, as can be seen in the directory "DIDA_325_Final_Project_Gradient_Boosted_Model.ipynb".
